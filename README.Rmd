# GeoTcgaData

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of GeoTcgaData is to deal with RNA-seq, DNA Methylation, and Copy 
number variation data in GEO and TCGA.

## Installation

You can install the released version of GeoTcgaData from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("GeoTcgaData")
```
GEO and TCGA provide us with a wealth of data, such as RNA-seq, DNA Methylation, 
and Copy number variation data. It's easy to download data from TCGA using the 
gdc tool, but processing these data into a format suitable for bioinformatics 
analysis requires more work. This R package was developed to handle these data.
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(GeoTcgaData)

#' Multiple genes symbols may correspond to a same id. Some people think

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
