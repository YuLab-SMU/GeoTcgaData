Description: Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
    provide us with a wealth of data, such as RNA-seq, DNA Methylation, SNP
    and Copy number variation data. It's easy to download data from TCGA using the 
    gdc tool, but processing these data into a format suitable for bioinformatics 
    analysis requires more work. This R package was developed to handle these data.
